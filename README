An ancient implementation of the Snake game. It was originally programmed in the early
2002 or so, and was meant to run under DOS with the Allegro library.

Incomplete but kinda fun none the less... originally it was planned to run it on
embedded devices with touch screens (which emulate mouse clicks) so a mouse is
required.

It's doubtful if I will ever finish this.
